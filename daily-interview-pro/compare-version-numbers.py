"""
Version numbers are strings that are used to identify unique states of software products.
A version number is in the format a.b.c.d. and so on where a, b, etc. are numeric strings separated by dots.
These generally represent a hierarchy from major to minor changes.
Given two version numbers version1 and version2, conclude which is the latest version number. Your code should do the following:
If version1 > version2 return 1.
If version1 < version2 return -1.
Otherwise return 0.

Input: 
version1 = "1.0.33"
version2 = "1.0.27"
Output: 1 
#version1 > version2

Input:
version1 = "0.1"
version2 = "1.1"
Output: -1
#version1 < version2

Input: 
version1 = "1.01"
version2 = "1.001"
Output: 0
#ignore leading zeroes, 01 and 001 represent the same number. 

Input:
version1 = "1.0"
version2 = "1.0.0"
Output: 0
#version1 does not have a 3rd level revision number, which
defaults to "0"
